      directory. This function should be called at program startup, to
      ensure that the VBDs that leaked during the last run of the program
      that abnormally terminated do get cleaned up.
      If an exception happens while cleaning up a VBD, it is just logged, but
      not propagated to the caller, and will not interrupt the cleanup of the
      rest of the VBDs. However, unexpected errors that occur while
      reading the persistent list of VBDs to clean up, other than the file
      not existing, will cause this function to fail and will be
      propagated to the caller.
